                        tasks later. Happy bosses mean happy programmers!</p>

                    <p>The best way to review is together with the author of the code. You propose changes and decide,
                        together with the author, how difficult it will be to implement various refactoring techniques.
                        Small changes can be made right on the spot.</p>
